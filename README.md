# Hi, I am Paras

I am passionate about leveraging technology to automate and streamline complex banking operations. Recently, I have been expanding my skills in Python and SQL by developing practical automation projects that combine coding with real-world workflows. Alongside this, I have gained hands-on experience with **Jira** and **Confluence**, two industry-standard tools widely used in banking and operations teams for task management and documentation.

### My Projects:

#### 1. SSI Validation Engine

A beginner-level project focused on cleaning and validating Standing Settlement Instructions (SSIs) â€” a critical part of trade settlement processes.  
Using Python (pandas) and SQLite, I built a solution to process large datasets, detect discrepancies, and generate validation reports. This project demonstrates my ability to handle data quality challenges and automate repetitive tasks efficiently.

#### 2. Corporate Actions Reconciliation & Cash Automation

This project automates key operational tasks for fixed income instruments, including entitlement verification for coupon and redemption events, cash reconciliation, exception reporting, and generation of release instructions.  
It showcases advanced SQL and Python skills applied to real-world banking scenarios, improving accuracy and reducing manual workload.

#### 3. Banking Ops Jira Automation

To complement the above data-centric projects, I designed and documented a set of Jira automation rules tailored to banking operations workflows. These rules streamline task prioritization, auto-assignment, timely reminders for stagnant tasks, and automated closure of resolved tickets â€” all aligned with service level agreements (SLAs).  
The detailed Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is documented in **Confluence**, demonstrating my ability to produce clear, professional documentation alongside technical automation.
