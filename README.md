###  Hi, I am Paras

I recently started learning Python and SQL, and built my first automation project combining both.

 Check out my project here: [SSI Validation Engine](https://github.com/paras1234-eng/ssi-validation-engine)

ðŸ’¡ This beginner-level project demonstrates how to:
- Clean and validate Standing Settlement Instructions (SSIs)
- Use Python (pandas) and SQLite
- Process data, detect issues, and save output

 I created this to showcase my interest in data automation and operations.

Thanks for visiting!
