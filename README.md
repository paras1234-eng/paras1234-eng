Hi, I am Paras

I recently started learning Python and SQL, and built two automation projects combining both.

[SSI Validation Engine](https://github.com/paras1234-eng/ssi-validation-engine)
A beginner-level project that demonstrates how to:
Clean and validate Standing Settlement Instructions (SSIs)
Use Python (pandas) and SQLite
Process data, detect issues, and save outputs
https://github.com/paras1234-eng/corp_action_recon_cash

This project automates:
Entitlement checks for coupon/redemption events
Cash reconciliation for fixed income instruments
Exception reporting and release instruction generation

I created these to showcase my interest in data automation and real-world operations workflows.

Thanks for visiting!
