Hi, I am Paras

I recently started learning Python and SQL, and built two automation projects combining both, along with practical experience in Jira and Confluence for banking operations automation.

SSI Validation Engine

A beginner-level project that demonstrates how to:

Clean and validate Standing Settlement Instructions (SSIs)

Use Python (pandas) and SQLite

Process data, detect issues, and save outputs

https://github.com/paras1234-eng/corp_action_recon_cash

This project automates:

Entitlement checks for coupon/redemption events

Cash reconciliation for fixed income instruments

Exception reporting and release instruction generation

Banking Ops Jira Automation

A project demonstrating task automation and workflow rules in Jira tailored for banking operations teams. It includes automation of:

Task triage and priority labelling

Automatic task assignment

Stale task reminders

Auto-closing of resolved issues

SOP document and detailed workflow logic are available here:

I created these to showcase my interest in data automation and real-world operations workflows.

Thanks for visiting!
